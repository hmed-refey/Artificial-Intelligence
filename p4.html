<h2>Artificial Intelligence :</h2>
The word Artificial Intelligence comprises of two words “Artificial” and “Intelligence”. Artificial refers to something which is made by human or non natural thing and Intelligence means ability to understand or think. There is a misconception that Artificial Intelligence is a system, but it is not a system .AI is implemented in the system. There can be so many definition of AI, one definition can be “It is the study of how to train the computers so that computers can do things which at present human can do better.”Therefore It is a intelligence where we want to add all the capabilities to machine that human contain.
<h3>Intelligence is composed of:</h3>


<li>(1)Reasoning</li>      
<li>(2)Learning</li>     
<li>(3)Problem Solving</li>    
<li>(4)Perception</li>       
<li>(5)Linguistic Intelligence</li>     
Many tools are used in AI, including versions of search and mathematical optimization, logic, methods based on probability and economics. The AI field draws upon computer science, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuro-science, artificial psychology and many others.

<h3>Need for Artificial Intelligence: </h3>
  

<li>(1)To create expert systems which exhibit intelligent behavior with the capability to learn, demonstrate, explain and advice its users.</li>         
<li>(2)Helping machines find solutions to complex problems like humans do and applying them as algorithms in a computer-friendly manner.</li>
<h2>Machine Learning :</h2>
Machine Learning is the learning in which machine can learn by its own without being explicitly programmed. It is an application of AI that provide system the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience. Here we can generate a program by integrating input and output of that program. One of the simple definition of the Machine Learning is “Machine Learning is said to learn from experience E w.r.t some class of task T and a performance measure P if learners performance at the task in the class as measured by P improves with experiences.

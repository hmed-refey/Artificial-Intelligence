<h2>What Is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?</h2>
Artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans. And it is also a branch of computer science, involved in the research, design, and application of intelligent computer. Traditional methods for modeling and optimizing complex structure systems require huge amounts of computing resources, and artificial-intelligence-based solutions can often provide valuable alternatives for efficiently solving problems in the civil engineering. This paper summarizes recently developed methods and theories in the developing direction for applications of artificial intelligence in civil engineering, including evolutionary computation, neural networks, fuzzy systems, expert system, reasoning, classification, and learning, as well as others like chaos theory, cuckoo search, firefly algorithm, knowledge-based engineering, and simulated annealing. The main research trends are also pointed out in the end. The paper provides an overview of the advances of artificial intelligence applied in civil engineering.
<h2>Why Artificial Intelligence is important?</h2>
Artificial Intelligence is not just a part of computer science even it's so vast and requires lots of other factors which can contribute to it. To create the AI first we should know that how intelligence is composed, so the Intelligence is an intangible part of our brain which is a combination of Reasoning, learning, problem-solving perception, language understanding, etc.

To achieve the above factors for a machine or software Artificial Intelligence requires the following discipline:

<li>(1)Mathematics</li>
<li>(2)Biology</li>
<li>(3)Psychology</li>
<li>(4)Sociology</li>
<li>(5)Computer Science</li>
<li>(6)Neurons Study</li>
<li>(7)Statistics</li>
